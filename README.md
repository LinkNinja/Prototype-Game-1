# Unity – Prototype – 1
This game is a prototype created from Unity Create with code series on Unitylearn.com. The prototype is a simple driving game, where you control a tank down a straight road. The road has obstacles which you can choose to avoid. The speed of your vehicle and the RPM are displayed to you. Crashing into the obstacles on the road may cause your vehicle to flip over. If one of your wheels is lifted off the ground as you drive your vehicles rpm and speed will stop and your vehicle will slow down. If your vehicle flips on its side, it will slide to a stop or until it falls of the road. The vehicle is a tank from the preselected assets presented in the create with code series. The turret on top of the tank can be rotated but contains no further functionality. Pressing the Space bar Once allows the Camera to change to a different perspective, but it does not allow it to change back to its original after pressing it once. There is a secondary camera included in the Hierarchy of the scene. The Secondary Camera can be activated by disabling the Main Camera and enabling the Secondary Camera.
